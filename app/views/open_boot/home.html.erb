          This summer had it's ups and downs but overall it was a lot of fun and very productive. The student
          business incubator "Vehicle" was official established. So I achieved my goal of starting an 
          organization at my school Bethune-Cookman University. We started with 23 application and we are now
          down to 4 member and 1 volunteer; I am very grateful to Adeje Bagumba for coming to help. We will start
          off the semester doing some heavy recruiting. This also mean I can return to the technology
          projects that I started back in January.<br><br>
          
          I also was able to take a very useful course at Cooper U (no relation). Cooper is a management consulting firm
          located off Market Street in San Francisco; which is a really good location for a foodie. The office was really nice
          and I met some very interesting people who worked everywhere from the GSA to Scullcandy and 
          Price-Waterhouse-Cooper (again no relation). The course I took there was "Design Leadership" and I would tell you about it but
          you should take the course if you want to know.

          The summer started and I had to put these project on hold. This summer I am running a training/orientation
          camp for "Vehicle"; a student business incubator I am founding. I have come to a good stopping point. 
          The basic idea is to have an app for cognitive science majors to Design a search engine/web scrappers that 
          could analyze web page content by subject matter.</p>

          <p>I found this parser program in a Ruby-On-Rails tutorial on YouTube. I'm going to tweak it a little bit. I don't really want to make the app that the guy in the tutorial did because I didn't find it that interesting. When I'm finished putting together the basic version of the other apps, I'll come back and redesign this and get it to do more stuff.  </p>

          <p>I have just about finished the basic function of this app. It is going to be a sort of crawler/bot that uses word association to determine which synonyms are closest to a searched word. This app is very important to making the next app. Which will be a search engine that returns pages based on the analysis of the language in pages. </p>

          <p>Tt looks like I ran out of time before I got too much work to finish this. From March to June I'll be busy establishing a business incubator at my school. But, hopefully I can return to this project. It's supposed to be a crawler that analyzes website content to identify subject matter. I was hoping that cognitive sciences students could use it.</p>

                  <p>This IOT project isn't just for fun and experimentation. The Comp Sci students and I are hoping that every Computer Engineering and Information Systems student will build their
                  SWCC ("sw-uck") and setup there own WUCKIE ("wookie"). The SWCC is like a Cloud 9 and Github contained in a Raspberry Pi 3. Building a SWCC consists of install an Apache Webserver
                  on to a Raspberry Pi 3. Then we configure the localhost & Linux server for guest to log in and use the app or site  being developed. The underlying magic is that its a system where
                  that allows logged in users to push and pull from each other systems through a Wifi connection. There are different permissions set to where only Admins will be able to push to
                  the localhost. Raspberry already comes with Python but we are also going to outfit it with ruby. The WUCKIE is a virtual machine that is a lot like the Dynos on Heroku. We are setting 
                  this up conventionally at first, but next we want to tailor this within the Linux Kernel so that we can integrate  a Heroku API so that we can push directly from he SWCC to Heroku</p>
